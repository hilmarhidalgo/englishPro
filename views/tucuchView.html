                  Good afternoon everyone. I'm going to tell you a little bit about my life, from when I was an infant until today. I hope you're going to like it.

                The truth is, from my early childhood, between zero and six years old, I don't remember much. But I do remember that I was going to be very mischievous, and I really liked to be mean to others, and I was always going to end up getting scolded.

              <p>
                  Then, between seven and thirteen years old, I think that's when I was going to have the most energy. I absolutely loved going out to the countryside to play soccer, and I was going to be even more mischievous. I remember my dad was always going to be running after me to scold me, but he was never going to be able to catch me. I also remember that I loved going with my maternal grandparents.

            <p>
              There are a couple of big events that really marked my life. One of them was when my grandmother passed away; that was going to be one of the hardest events of my life, but I learned to live with it. Another really important event was when I moved to live here in Cancún, since it was going to mean leaving my old life, my family, and all my friends, and it was not going to be easy at all.

              The things I used to enjoy the most were definitely going out to the countryside to play soccer, and going out with my friends to play arcade games; those are some of the things I am never going to forget.
