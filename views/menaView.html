                During my school years, I started playing baseball, winning individual and team trophies. Joining Pioneros and winning a championship was a very important moment. I later discovered soccer, which was going to become important , and I made good friends and learned teamwork.

              For my future, I am going to thrive in the gym; it is going to be my biggest aspiration. I also am going to learn and become more efficient in my career, finish it, and work in my field. I am going to be a better person than I was yesterday and am going to become successful—someone my family, friends, and I are going to be proud of.
