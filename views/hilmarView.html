                    some important moments in my life, explores my interests and hobbies, and also
                    presents the plans I have for the future.

            As far as I can remember, when I was very young, I was quite different from
            other children. I was very serious and had low energy. I didn’t cry much—not
            even on my first day of kindergarten. In photos from that time, I always looked
            very serious.

            As I grew a little older, I became more playful. I started running around more and
            smiling more often. One of my favorite things was visiting my grandparents'
            farm, where I loved playing with my cousins and spending time with the puppies

            a. An important moment in my life was when I was given a little dog
            named Rocky. He was my first pet, and I got him when I was still very
            young. I loved him deeply, and he quickly became a special part of my
            life.
            <br>
            b. Another important event in my life was when I moved to live in Cancún.
            Leaving behind all my friends and family was very difficult for me at
            such a young age. It was a big change that taught me a lot about
            adapting to new situations and starting over in a different place.

            Well, the things I want for my future are quite simple: to have stability, a home of
            my own, and a good job that allows me to work from home. Basically, I just want
            a good and peaceful life.
