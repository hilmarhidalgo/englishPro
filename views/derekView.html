            For my childhood stages, I had two school periods. 
            From ages 6 to 10, I was going to elementary school in Orizaba.
            I don't have many memories from that time, but I know I was going to be a happy and joyful kid.

            For my teenage days, I studied my last elementary year here in Cancún.
            Middle school was going to be a tough time in my life, not because something particularly bad happened, just the general challenges of being a teenager.
            However, I am going to have good memories with my friends Mauricio and Enrique; we were going to be really good friends back then.

            One of my very first good memories is going to be a trip to Mexico City when I was 4 years old. My grandma was going to see her dad, and before leaving, she asked my mom if I could come with her. That way, my mom was going to get some rest, and I was going to get to meet my great-grandfather. It was a week-long trip, and I am going to remember three things very clearly from that week. The first one was going to be seeing an expo about dinosaurs in the Zocalo. The second was going to be discovering Michael Jackson's music for the very first time; after a long day, we were heading back home, and my grandma stopped to greet a friend of hers. We spent like three hours there and maybe after one I was already bored so Ernesto (My Grandma's friend) handed me a set of three cd's of MJ. He turned on his Blu-ray and boom, my whole world just changed. The third and one of the most special ones is making a kaleidoscope (which still exists) with my late great-grandfather. Another key life event was going to be moving from Veracruz to Cancún because of my father's job. As a 10-year-old, I was so sad to leave my friends, my family, and the only city I had ever known. Just imagine a 10-year-old kid who's about to leave his friends, family, and the only city that he barely knows.

            <p>
            I don't think about the future that much, but I just want to be happy. Maybe I am going to be alone, maybe with a family, I don't know yet. Regarding what I'm going to do after I graduate (if I even graduate!), I also don't have any idea. I don't picture myself with a job making five figures, but I also don't picture myself unemployed, you feel me? I'm just trying to enjoy the present and the things I have now. That's it.

            <p>
            Like most men in Mexico, I grew up playing football. I am going to have many memories of playing in school, with my cousins, my friends, my dad, and even with strangers. That sport is always going to hold a special place in my life and heart. Also, one of my favorite hobbies is going to be listening to music. That interest in music started in my second year of middle school, all because of my friend at the time, Sofía. She used to spend almost every free moment with her headphones and phone, and I remember watching her bobbing her head. One time, I asked her what she was listening to, and yeah, that's pretty much how it started. The people closest to me know my relationship with movies, and yes, I love movies too.
